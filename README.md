# Vehicle Selling Price Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the factors that influence vehicle selling prices. The analysis leverages a dataset spanning several cities over the course of approximately one decade, with a particular focus on identifying key trends and patterns that affect the pricing of vehicles. 

## Key Objectives

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The project places a strong emphasis on exploratory data analysis, uncovering insights into the distribution of vehicle prices, identifying potential correlations, and highlighting patterns that influence price variations across different categories.
  
- **Handling Missing Values and Outliers:** A critical aspect of this analysis was the statistical treatment of missing numerical data and outliers. Through a careful and methodical approach, missing values were imputed and outliers were handled to ensure the integrity and reliability of the analysis.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Initial efforts focused on addressing missing numerical values and identifying outliers. These decisions were driven by a thorough understanding of the dataset and supported by statistical justifications, ensuring that the data was properly prepared for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploratory analysis involved detailed visualizations and statistical summaries to investigate how various factors such as vehicle age, mileage, brand, and location influence selling price. This stage provided the foundation for understanding key pricing determinants in the dataset.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas, SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data analysis, visualization, and handling missing values and outliers
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data exploration
- **GitHub** for version control

## Key Findings
The analysis reveals that vehicle age and mileage are the strongest predictors of selling price, exhibiting negative correlations for both sedan and SUV types. While vehicle condition also shows a positive correlation with price, its strength is relatively low, indicating a need for further investigation into additional influencing factors. Significant price differences are observed among transmission types, with manual SUVs commanding higher prices than their automatic counterparts, and automatic sedans being more valuable than manual sedans. Additionally, color impacts selling prices, underscoring its role as a non-rational factor influenced by emotional preferences. This comprehensive examination highlights the multifaceted nature of vehicle pricing, integrating both rational performance metrics and subjective buyer preferences.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of a methodical approach in data analysis, particularly when dealing with missing values and outliers. Through robust exploratory analysis, we uncovered key factors that affect vehicle prices, providing valuable insights for potential sellers and buyers alike.
